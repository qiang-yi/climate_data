These programs aggregate daily climate data (rainfall, tmax, and tmin) from 1990 to 2014 into daily average. 

**Rainfall.ipynb**: aggregating daily rainfall rasters (around 9133 rasters) into daily average temperature(366 rasters).

**T_Max.ipynb**: aggregating daily max temperature rasters (around 9133 rasters) into daily average t_max (366 rasters).

**T_Min.ipynb**: aggregating daily min temperature rasters (around 9133 rasters) into daily average t_min (366 rasters).

**raster_value_to_point.ipynb**: extracting values in the aggregated rasters into the point locations of the 22 sites. The output are 22 csv files including daily average of rainfall, tmax and tmin of the sites.
